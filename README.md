# Apress Source Code (Fork with macOS Support)

This repository accompanies [*Modern Arm Assembly Language Programming*](https://www.apress.com/9781484262665) by Daniel Kusswurm (Apress, 2020).

This fork has been modified to allow compilation and execution of the examples on **macOS**.  
The original source code is available in the official Apress repository, while here you will find the necessary adjustments to make it work properly on Apple machines with ARM processors.
